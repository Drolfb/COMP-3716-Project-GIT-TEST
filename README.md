This is our volleyball tournament application and this is how it works. 

1. You start in a menu where you can select between 4 different roles being Manager, Coach, Referee, and Spectator. Each one
having different menus with the manager having access to everything.

2. Once you click on one of the four options you go to a login screen(For this example we'll be using Manager because he has 
complete access to everything). Choose between different users in the dropbox or or make a new one. 

3. You now 3 different options, Create Tournament, View Tournaments and Switch Manager. View Tournaments views all active tournaments,
create tournamnet makes a new tournament. and switch user switches the user you're currently logged in as. 

4. Once you're in create tournament, you have several different options for creating a tournament, all must be filled in before
you continue. 

5. From here you have 3 options, add team, view teams and then generate match ups depending on if the minimum team requirement
is complete. 

6. View Teams opens up the team's specialized page where you can add a new players and you can return back to the previous page. 
The add new players button opens up another page where you can new players to the team. 

7. Once all teams are in the tournament you can then generate the match ups by clicking the generate matchup button. 

8. The system now calculates the brackets and shows them in a table. From this menu there is now 2 buttons, manage score 
and generate next round.

9. Before you you click on the manage score button you must select a row in the table first. Once a row is selected from 
there you can click on manage score button which opens up another page where you can enter in scores for each of the teams and
then you hit the determine winner button and from there the system will calculate the winner. You can then hit return to go back 
to the previous bracket page. 

10. You then keep on generating new brackets until there's only 2 teams remaining. From there if you hit generate next 
round it will a brand new page with the winner.
